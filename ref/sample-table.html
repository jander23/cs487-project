<!--
So basically there should be a table per building.
Each entry contains a professor's name, office, maybe email?
Display next to detailed building maps.

Would ideally just pull staff from a database.
Using "what building is their office in?" data.
But that probably won't happen.
Alas.

These will probably mess up the tooltip mapping.
I don't know how to avoid that, unfortunately.

Ideally in the future:
*names would be fetched from database
*offices could be highlighted like other utilities
*nice pleasant system for adding more data
